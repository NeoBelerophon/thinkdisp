thinkdisp
=========

Display Manager/Unity Panel Indicator for Ubuntu+Bumblebee+Multimon and intel-virtual-output instead of screenclone

This is currently experimental, but works in general unless there is an issue with the underlying Bumblebee/Nvidia/Driver setup. The usual "dev not responsible for damage to your system" applies.
